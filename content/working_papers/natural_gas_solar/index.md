Natural gas has become a pivotal technology in the energy transition, as it can complement renewable generation at a lower emission rate compared to alternative fossil fuels. In countries with insufficient natural gas reserves, firms might exhibit suboptimal import levels relative to governmental preferences due to risk factors inherent in the procurement process. In this paper, we study different policies designed to incentivize larger natural gas orders and examine their impact on long-term renewable entry. Our research is conducted in Chile, a notable player in the adoption of solar energy, which implemented a novel policy to encourage the procurement of natural gas. We find that, even though the policy displaces coal usage, it simultaneously increases natural gas imports to such an extent that it counterbalances its positive effects on emissions. The removal of this policy would not only result in a short-term reduction in emissions but also stimulate increased solar energy adoption in the long run. Among the policies we examined, the implementation of a carbon price emerges as the optimal choice, as it elevates natural gas imports, lowers emissions in the short run, and maximizes solar energy entry in the long term.
