Why is wealth so highly concentrated at the top of the distribution? This paper provides an answer by studying the interplay between two crucial elements of wealth concentration: tax avoidance and portfolio decisions. By using micro-data from Chilean tax records, I quantify the sources of tax avoidance and find that the wealthiest individuals avoid proportionally more taxes. I calibrate a heterogeneous agent model Ã  la Beweley-Hugget-Aiyagari that departs from the standard approaches by including two features: (i) endogenous portfolio choices (safe v/s risky) and (ii) a tax framework that accounts for the presence of tax avoidance. The main mechanism is that tax avoidance rises the after-tax rate of return, causing agents to reallocate their portfolio towards risky assets, ultimately resulting in an even higher rate of return on wealth. The main result is that without tax avoidance, the top 1\% wealth share decreases from 50\%  to 11\%.
