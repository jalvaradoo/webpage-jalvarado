Why is wealth so highly concentrated at the top of the distribution? This paper addresses that question by examining the interplay between two critical factors for wealth concentration: tax avoidance and portfolio decisions. Using micro-data from Chilean tax records, I quantify tax avoidance. The main empirical finding is that the wealthiest individuals avoid proportionally more taxes through by significantly reducing the effective payments of corporate income tax and retaining profits within companies to dodge dividend taxes. To explore this further, I calibrate a Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari heterogeneous agent model, incorporating two departures from standard models: (i) endogenous portfolio choices between safe and corporate risky assets, and (ii) a tax framework that accounts for tax avoidance. The main intuition is that, given the presence of tax avoidance, the after-tax rate of return on risky assets increases, leading agents to reallocate their portfolio towards such assets, ultimately resulting in an even higher rate of return on wealth. The main quantitative results is that without tax avoidance, the top 1\% wealth share decreases from 50\%  to 17\%.
