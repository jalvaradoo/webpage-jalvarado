The effect of meat consumption on the environment is well-documented, yet little is known about the effect of policies targeting environmentally harmful food choices. How would consumers respond to these policies? To answer this question, I build a structural model of the demand for meat which allows me to estimate rich substitution patterns accounting for heterogeneity in consumer tastes. I study three different policies: a 50% reduction of beef products on retail shelves, an environmental tax reflecting the environmental costs of food products, and advertisements for plant-based products that increase consumers' valuation of them. I also analyze the supply side to estimate how prices would change in equilibrium under these counterfactual scenarios. I find that imposing restrictions on beef products alone does not achieve a significant reduction in emissions. The consumer welfare loss is larger than the environmental gains, and its benefits can be easily matched with a small tax instead. Conversely, the tax and an increment on plant-based products' valuations prove to be more effective in reducing emissions. However, the burden of the tax policy is born disproportionately by underprivileged consumers. The environmental benefits of the tax come mainly from consumers switching to poultry and pork products. Therefore, a policy that subsidizes these types of meat products while taxing beef might achieve more progressive results.
