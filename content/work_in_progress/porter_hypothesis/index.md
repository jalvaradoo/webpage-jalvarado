Why does the redistributing power of fiscal policy differ from country to country?. Although income inquality tends to be the same before taxes and tranfers across countries, inequality tends to increase or decrease significantly after taxes and transfers are applied. I develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents in which the degree of redistribution of fiscal policy is chosen endogenously. The results show that de degree of redistribution is determined by: (i) the magnitude of economic shocks, and (ii) the rules under which taxes are selected.
