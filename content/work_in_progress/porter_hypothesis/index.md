Why does the redistributive impact of fiscal policy vary across countries? While income inequality tends to be similar across nations before taxes and transfers, the degree of inequality can change significantly after these fiscal interventions. I develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, where the extent of redistribution is determined endogenously. The findings reveal that the degree of redistribution is influenced by: (i) the magnitude of economic shocks, and (ii) the institutional rules under which fiscal policy is chosen.
